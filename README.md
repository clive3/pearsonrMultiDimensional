# pearsonrMultiDimensional
performs pearson correlation on multi-dimensional numpy arrays

please note that this function correlates a 1D numpy array with
the first dimension of a multi-dimensional array with the np.mean
of the remiaining dimensions

please use the test file to show the working

NB the size of the 1D array has to be exactly the same size as the
first dimension of the multi-dimension array
